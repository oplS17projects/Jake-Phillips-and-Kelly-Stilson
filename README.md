### Statement
Describe your project. Why is it interesting? Why is it interesting to you personally? What do you hope to learn? 
Our project is a game styled inspired by Donkey Kong. Jacob's girlfriends, grand-father helped to develop the original 
Donkey Kong and Kelly has played it a couple times.
It is interesting because we both wrote similar games in C++ for previous courses and we are using them as inspiration.

We hope to learn more about the similarities and differences between OOP and Functional Programming techniques. 

### Analysis
Explain what approaches from class you will bring to bear on the project.

Be explicit about the techiques from the class that you will use. For example:

- Will you use data abstraction? How?
- Will you use recursion? 
We plan to use recursion in the main function to run the game. 
- Will you use map/filter/reduce?
We plan to use map to create the background/stage layout for the game.
- Will you use object-orientation? 
We plan to use Object -orientation with our main Character. It will have characteristics.
- Will you use functional approaches to processing your data? 

- Will you use state-modification approaches? 
We will use state-modification approaches to maintain the state of the game(win, lost, etc).
- Will you build an expression evaluator, like we did in the symbolic differentatior and the metacircular evaluator?
No, we do not plan to do this at this time.
- Will you use lazy evaluation approaches?
Yes, I plan to approach this project in my pajamas, on the couch, with a large bag of chips.

The idea here is to identify what ideas from the class you will use in carrying out your project. 

**Your project will be graded, in part, by the extent to which you adopt approaches from the course into your implementation, _and_ your discussion about this.**

### External Technologies
If possible, we would like the game to have the ability to save high-scores in a database on the web.
In order to this, we would have to create a database to store the information, have the game access it, and allow the player
to decide if they want to store it for future reference.

We may incorporate sounds or images from the web.

### Deliverable and Demonstration
The end game is a game.
During the live demo people should be able to play it, and enjoy it. They will be able to compete to beat their friends, or prove 
to their enemies that they are superior.

### Evaluation of Results
We will know we are sucessfull if people are able to play the game.
Frustration regarding the outcome or score of the game is not a concern when evaluating success or failure on our part.

## Architecture Diagram
Upload the architecture diagram you made for your slide presentation to your repository, and include it in-line here.


## Schedule
Explain how you will go from proposal to finished product. 
Lots of hard work and determination, late nights and frustration. Hopefully no smashed computers.

The nature of deliverables depend on your project, but may include things like processed data ready for import, core algorithms implemented, interface design prototyped, etc. 

Write concrete steps for your schedule to move from concept to working system. 

### First Milestone (Sun Apr 9)
Which portion of the work will be completed (and committed to Github) by this day? 
-Splash Screen(Main menu)
-Stage One-Background Tiles
-Character 
-Character movement
-Score calculations

### Second Milestone (Sun Apr 16)
Which portion of the work will be completed (and committed to Github) by this day? 
-Stage One complete
-Stage Two thru Five-Background tiles
-Character Development- Added Super Powers
-Score Tracking

### Public Presentation (Mon Apr 24, Wed Apr 26, or Fri Apr 28 [your date to be determined later])
What additionally will be completed before the public presentation?
-Stage One thru Five complete
-All Character movement and interactions
-High scores tracked and stored in database.

## Group Responsibilities
Here each group member gets a section where they, as an individual, detail what they are responsible for in this project. Each group member writes their own Responsibility section. Include the milestones and final deliverable.

Please use Github properly: each individual must make the edits to this file representing their own section of work.

**Additional instructions for teams of three:** 
* Remember that you must have prior written permission to work in groups of three (specifically, an approved `FP3` team declaration submission).
* The team must nominate a lead. This person is primarily responsible for code integration. This work may be shared, but the team lead has default responsibility.
* The team lead has full partner implementation responsibilities also.
* Identify who is team lead.

In the headings below, replace the silly names and GitHub handles with your actual ones.
